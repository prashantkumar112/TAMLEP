# #   Accepts values of 'strict', 'flexible', and 'disabled'. The default
# #   value is 'flexible'. With strict channel priority, packages in lower
# #   priority channels are not considered if a package with the same name
# #   appears in a higher priority channel. With flexible channel priority,
# #   the solver may reach into lower priority channels to fulfill
# #   dependencies, rather than raising an unsatisfiable error. With channel
# #   priority disabled, package version takes precedence, and the
# #   configured priority of channels is used only to break ties. In
# #   previous versions of conda, this parameter was configured as either

Your python: python=3.10

If python is on the left-most side of the chain, that's the version you've asked for.
When python appears to the right, that indicates that the thing on the left is somehow
not available for the python version you are constrained to. Note that conda will not
change your python version to a different minor version unless you explicitly specify
that.

The following specifications were found to be incompatible with a past
explicit spec that is not an explicit spec in this operation (conda):
